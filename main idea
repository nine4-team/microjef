I'm creating a ewbsite called microjef.fun to commemorate my friend Jef's bachelor party in Death Valley.  I want people to be able to create little entries that have: title, free text, author, and image upload supported.  each entry becomes a tile on the site.  when clicked/tapped, it opens a full view of the entry.  the site is protected by a password ('Jef'), and on landing on the page and image of jef appears in a zany way, followed by teh password prompt.  when the right password is entered, users are prompted with a prompt for hte user to confirm they are at least 18 years of age.  when they click yes, the image spins away in a zany way.  OH, and when users land on the page, the title text reads 'Come take a walk together by yourself'.
